# Capturator Mini-Game

Welcome! This is one of my earliest mini-projects, developed when I began learning programming. It's a small **proof-of-concept** (POC) game that helped me practice front-end development fundamentals, using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About the Project

This mini-game lets you choose Pokémon to "capture" based on their rarity and a randomized difficulty. The outcome of each capture attempt depends on both the Pokémon's difficulty level (related to its rarity) and a random success factor.

The game includes:
- A limited number of capture attempts
- Some added lore for fun
- A chance to enter *your name* to personalize the experience!

### Project Versions

This project has two main versions:

1. **Prompts Version**: A text-based version where you choose options via prompt dialogs. This version focuses on using JavaScript prompts to evaluate your choices.

2. **Enhanced Version**: A more interactive version featuring:
   - A button-based input system
   - Multiple, dynamically styled pages
   - Enhanced visuals with styles and images for a more engaging experience

## Getting Started

To try the game locally:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-capture-mini-game.git
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to start playing!

Enjoy, and good luck capturing your favorite Pokémon!
