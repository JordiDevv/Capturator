# 🎮 Pokémon Capture Mini-Game 🎉

Welcome! This is one of my very first mini-projects, developed when I began learning programming. It's a small **proof-of-concept** (POC) game that helped me practice front-end development fundamentals, using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 🌐💻

## 🔍 About the Project

This mini-game lets you choose Pokémon to "capture" based on their rarity and a randomized difficulty. The outcome of each capture attempt depends on both the Pokémon's difficulty level (related to its rarity) and a random success factor. 🕹️✨

The game includes:
- 🎯 A limited number of capture attempts
- 📜 Fun lore to make it more engaging
- 📝 A chance to enter *your name* for a personalized experience!

### 🔄 Project Versions

This project has two main versions:

1. **Prompt Version** 📋: A text-based version where you make choices via prompt dialogs. This version focuses on using JavaScript prompts to evaluate your choices.

2. **Enhanced Version** 🌟: A more interactive version featuring:
   - 🖱️ A button-based input system
   - 📄 Multiple, dynamically styled pages
   - 🎨 Enhanced visuals with styles and images for a more engaging experience

## 🚀 Getting Started

To try the game locally:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-capture-mini-game.git
   ```

2. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to start playing! 🎉

Have fun, and good luck capturing your favorite Pokémon! 🐾✨
